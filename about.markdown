The personal blog of someone you shouldn't trust or listen to. Hopefully it's entertaining though. 

Hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll. [Source.](https://github.com/l8am/l8am.github.io)

No analytics are taken (by me, GitHub tracks IPs of visitors to GitHub Pages), no comment sections are offered, and I really don't care if anyone reads this. This doesn't exist for clout. This mostly exists in a feeble attempt to contribute to an old-fashioned Internet: an internet where you could find all sorts of single purpose sites and personal blogs. This is especially reminiscent of old sites full of questionable information and spurious conclusions. 

Thank you for visiting!
